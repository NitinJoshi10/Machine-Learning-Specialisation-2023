# Machine-Learning-Specialization-2023

My solved assignments of the Machine Learning Specialization course by Andrew NG on Coursera.

The Coursera platform provides a Machine Learning Specialization that could be a good starting point for those interested in joining the artificial intelligence field. However, it is important to note that the programming assignments available in the repository should only be used as a reference or aid in case of difficulty. Participants of the course are advised against copying and pasting code directly, as this will not assist in learning. It is recommended to watch all lecture videos, complete quizzes, and write code assignments independently, as the course material is relatively easy to comprehend.
